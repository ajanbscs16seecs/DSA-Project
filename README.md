## Guide to github support in netbeans:


### Make new branch
first go to master branch...

- Switch to master first:
`team ->branches->switch branch`

- Pull:
`team->remote->pull`

- Create new branch:
`team->branches->create new branch`


### How to commit (local changes)
commit is just like saving your changes locally.

- First make sure you have selected all the colored files in project.

- Go to team->commit

- make sure the correct branch name appears on the dialog window.(the one you created)

- write commit message and commit

### How to push (to github)

- make sure you have committed all files(there won't be any colored files).

- go to:
`team->remote -> push`

- select correct branch. make sure you don't select master branch.. select only one. (the one you created)
